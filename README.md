This project is a website built from HTML and CSS that describes Stephen Feddes. It was programmed by Stephen Feddes.
The project includes the HTML file stephen-feddes-website.html and the CSS file all-about-me.css.
The picture of me was taken by James Zumhagen. Most of the code was handtyped. When I was unsure, for example, how to do the background color, I looked how W3C did it and then I customized the color myself. I would try to handtype as much as I could, but if I couldn't get what I wanted, I used W3C's tutorial for assistance.
